The time the off the dinosaurs

One time a t\\rex was chasing to have his food,his legs were slowing
down . He was opening his jaw and ready to chomp the food up but it was
so far away from home to walk or run then he saw this masive frog and
when it jumped it was like a Earthquake .

The frog me a ride home . It took me and Bob the frog 15 hours to get
home it was in the afternoon and my name is Sam do you want to be frends

then it's evil the book is in a glass box and it's indestructible . some
