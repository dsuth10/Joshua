There was a guy named Max he owned an amazing shoe store he had a lot of
costumers the costumers loved Max because he was the best shoemaker in
all the town.

Max could fix any shoe work boots, sneakers, and all the others it was a
small shop, and he got thousands of shoes to make, and it was only him
working their Max worked for hours.

Max thought of an idea he was going to put the costumers\' shoes on
because he was bored, he was he was looking for a size 10 because he was
a size 10, he was looking until suddenly he found a hole section of size
ten Max put own of the shoes on when suddenly he turned into the person
who owned the shoes he was suprised he jumped out of his seat ahh.

Max tried all the tens on they all did the same thing Max turned into
the people Max took advantage of that he would walk around looking like
the other people he even tried the hi heles on and he turned into a girl
oh no i have change and go back to the shop.

Max had to keep making shoes and kept making the shoes but out of know
where the shoe machine stopped working he had this basement full of
boxes he went down there and he uncovered and old shoe machine that he
had to pedal Max didn\'t like to pedal but he had to finish the shoes
and he gave the shoes back and went back to his job and it never
