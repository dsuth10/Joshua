professional drifter. His car is an old Mazda RX7 he was proud of him
self because he was one of the best drifters in Japan. After each win he
got he would be interviewed by the fox racing team. Today was a really
rainy day and that means the track was as slippery as Sope on a water
slide. So he had to be as careful as he could. Zoom the race started and
he flew past every one and was in first place.

He was cheering so much that he had for got he was on the track racing
and slid of the track into the wall and his car lit on fire.
