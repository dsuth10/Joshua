Cured Happiness

Thank you\...

\*yawn\* "Another day, another way." the girl muttered. Meet Kiro K, a
silent but smart kid. Kiro wasn't like others. Instead, she was a little
pea sized homeschool ordinary 9-year-old kid, always wearing a mini
sequin top. The only time I\'d ever see her is when she roams around the
jungle type garden. Though at least she was creative. She was born with
an issue. Because of that issue she has lost most interest and emotion.
Life sounds tough for her. She lives in a mini cute cabin with lots of
decorations.

People sometimes catch her smiling. Barely. Though today changed. Just
her doing some work, until her mum called her over to the jungle like
garden. Her mum explained about some new "cure" to emotionless people.
Kiro didn't believe it, and she stomped further into the jungle garden
saying she wasted her time. Her olive braided hair waved around.

As Kiro stomped around the garden she went across the line, she is no
longer at her garden. She didn't hesitate and continued until she nearly
tripped over something sharp. She turned and saw a mini glass with
something covering the opening, inside was this weird, purple liquid,
the date said 27/1/2026. Today is 28/1/2026, so she removed the mini
leather material covering the opening and took a sip. The liquid
travelled down her throat and out of nowhere, she fell to the ground, no
signs of injuries.

Later she woke up, in her bed, it felt like the day had start over, but
a single mini emotion drifted in her body, before she could react, she
felt emotions. For the first time ever. She felt a mixture of confusion
and happiness, she ran to her mum and dad and explained everything.

"Thank you\..." whispered Kiro. And that, was the end of Kiro's sadness.
