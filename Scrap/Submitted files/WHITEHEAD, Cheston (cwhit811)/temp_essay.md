Jerry went exploring in is boat down a river with his best friend,
called Bob and the river was really ruff. They had never been down the
river they were going thew today.

Bob and Jerry had to stop because they saw a waterfall, but they
couldn\'t stop they were already going way to fast to stop. They didn\'t
want to lose their awesome big boat because it was so expensive and
cool.

The two friends quickly jumped out of the boat onto land and the boat
whent flinging of the edge.On land Bob andJerry ran down the steap hill
and got to there boat and took there tools out of there backpack and
started to repear the boat. Then they had finished fixing the boat. Bob
and Jerry started digging and putting the dirt in the river to make a
ramp so they can get up the waterfall and go back home.
