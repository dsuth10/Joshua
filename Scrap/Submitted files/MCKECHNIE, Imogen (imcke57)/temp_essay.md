Once upon a time their was a little girl who went for a walk in the
forest

She hated every day of her life she wanted a change.one morning she
heard a strange sound coming towards her! " ROAR!''

Yet again the little girl went for a stroll in the forest she found a
lost bunny. She took it with her to the deep cold lake suddenly the
water rised no-one knew were she was she was in danger\...

When she found a long peace of rope someone had rescued her she was safe

And she knew never to go there again. Back at home none of her family
cared

That she was in danger all they said was "GET TO BED NOW''! And angrily.

When one morning she found a dusty old bottle she touched it and a weird
blue person came out of it "i will grant you three wishes'' "what\'s
g-going on''.

"what is your first wish'' said the genie "I want to love every day

Of my life'' replied the little girl "so that will be it'' shouted the
genie

" what is your second wish'' " to be powerful'' "then it will be so''

" and finally what is your third wish'' " to live in the jungle'' "then
it shall be so''.

The little girl had every thing she ever wanted no more bossy parents,
no more going to

Bed at 6:00, no more disgusting food for dinner, no more getting teased
at school it was finally what she wanted like to live in the jungle and
make freinds with all the jungle animals " finally all I wanted ever''
she loved her life now yes indeed she loved it

"I love my new life the end
