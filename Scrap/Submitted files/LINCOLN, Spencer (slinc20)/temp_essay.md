*Title: THE END*

*There was one a boy named Steven he was 8, he always wondered or
dreamed about this one cave, it was a very oddly, shaped cave and a very
mythical cave he* *didn\'t know I\'ve it was real or not it had many
story lines to it. He always wanted to see it even go inside the cave;
he went on a long, lonely journey on the way he saw many species of
animals. THEN something happens he had been takin to an unwelcoming
tribe of bandits who were set out to stop him on his journey.*

*The next time he woke up he saw he was in a cage but that\'s all he
could see his eyes went pitch black repeatedly numerous time he
couldn\'t even catch a glimpse of who took him and, he didn\'t even know
how it happened it was a strait up bush attack he had no idea how he was
meant to escape until the poison stopped it wouldn\'t go black he could
see it was still night so he had to be 10x quieter otherwise the bandits
would wake up, he felt blown away and confused \`why are they so annoyed
that I am going to a cave\`.*

*But as soon as he got out of the cage that the bandits forgot to lock,
he ran fast a leopard at full speed he made it to a beach the cave was
there.*

*He had heard lots of stories many people die there* *there was no
escape after he started, he had no idea on how hard this would really
be; to make it even harder he forgot ropes he started waves splashed at
him while he was climbing up the jagged rocks he barely made it in. He
slipped as soon as he got into the cave nearly fracturing his skull only
minor injuries occurred to steven the next time he woke up he was in the
hospital he didn\'t now I\'ve it was a dream or not.*
