Name: Milah Whip

Title: The Magic Book!

Setting: Tall Mountain

Character: lucy a blond little girl and bob a boy with brown hair.

As Lucy wandered up the tall mountain with her best friend Bob, she saw
a little cave with a bright light shining out. As she turned her head to
tell Bob she realised, he had wandered off into the tall wide trees and
bushes.

As she ran to the cave in a panic she saw a big gold, glowing book full
of spells and curses. Without thinking she picked up the spell book and
started saying a spell which was 'To the left is blue,to the right is
green, Bring Bob back like it was all a dream'.

As the room started spinning round, she saw out of the corner of her eye
Bob, just wandering what was happening. Just as the room finally stopped
spinning, she asked Bob if he knew where he wandered off too.

But as Bob always is he always was he was as clueless as a chickpea.
They both decided that it would be a good idea to call it a day and go
home. On the way back to the village, they saw their parents looking for
them as the parents saw the kids a starting sprinting to the kids, they
told the kids never to leave the village again.
