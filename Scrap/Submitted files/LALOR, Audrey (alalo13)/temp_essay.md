Title: willow

Willow was a pearl white cat who loved the outdoors. She had no owners
so she was a stray cat. The other stray cats did not linger near Willow,
they thought she was strange witch hurt willow very badly. Willow used
to live in a big white house. She loved it there but one day she
followed a butterfly heading away from home. Willow followed it but got
lost, she looked everywhere but could not find home.

One morning Willow woke up and saw a pearl necklace. It looked like the
one her owner used to wear. Willow jumped up with excitement! This could
be her chance to find her owner again. She sniffed the necklace to get
its scent and picked it up with her mouth.

Willow started to walk. She could hear the chirping sounds of birds
filling her ears. She could pick up the scent of her owner they were
really close she could feel it. she suddenly looked up and saw her
house! She was so happy, she ran to the door and scratched at it, but no
one opened it. Willow was losing hope she scratched at it for a while
but no one came. Willows ears drooped. She felt empty inside.

Suddenly Willow saw the door handle twisting. It opened but it was not a
human it was another cat. "hello\" the cat said. "Oh um\...hi." Willow
said nervously. "Would you like to come in?" the cat said. "Sure" Willow
replied. Willow walked in and saw so many cats, she was shocked. "this
is the place were the lost cats go." said the cat. "Would you like to
stay?" it was a tough decision but willow said yes.

Willow soon got used to the place and was very happy there. Willow made
a lot of friends and new she made the right decision.
