Jimmy And the Ghost Net

One day at the gold coast, Jimmy the orca went further away from the
shoreline than normal, to explore. He saw some cool fish he had never
seen before, but whenever he went over to say hi, they ran away,
screaming "IT'S GONNA EAT US!" and pointed at him.

Jimmy went out a bit further and saw this weird thing that was not
responding to Jimmy when he said hi. He went over to see what it was,
when it suddenly grabbed Jimmy and strangled Jimmy in an impossible
knot. Jimmy couldn't reach the surface to breath! He wriggled and
squirmed, but he just couldn\'t get away.

Jimmy then saw something in the water. It was a fishing hook! Jimmy
grabbed the hook and cut the rope. He rushed to the surface and was
greeted by the embrace of fresh air.

Jimmy went back to his pod and told them his adventures and the ghost
net, he also told them how he would be dead right now if it wasn't for a
fishing hook.

THE END
