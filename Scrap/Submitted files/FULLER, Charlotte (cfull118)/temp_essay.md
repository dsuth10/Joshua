Summer break in basement

With best friend Rylee

Finds a mysterious box and opens it only to be stuck In a forest

Fairy\'s help them to get out and then they win an award winning film
for what the went throw that day

On an enchanting, day Olivia and Rylee were having a sleep over for
spring break had arrived the golden flowers bloomed and crisp leave fell
on freshly cut grass. As Rylee stepped out of her car and rung the bell
they lived in a small neighbour hood with little cozy cottages spread
around the coast shortly after her arrival, they had already started
playing hind and seek it was Rylee's turn to hide she bellowed down the
cobble stone stairs she was hiding down next toa big cardboard box when
she noticed a noise coming from an old wooden chest as her hands reached
out in front of her eye's bam! Olivia shot into the room

"I found you "Yes!"

Rylee:\" come here now" her voice shattered both of the hearts pounding
like a wild drum.

Ahhh they were sucked into a mini portal soon the basement wasn\'t so
cozy anymore and instead it turned into misty dence forest soon mmhhh
the sound was back but louder as we stepped forwards it was light as a
feather almost as if we were flying, we followed the poetic sounds we
soon were eble to spot a big den we flout down ever so slightly into the
cave the further we entered pop!

'Hello sisters "a tinny fairy appeared right in front of us it, golden
wing glow as if they were gold

"your a fairy" I stuttered
