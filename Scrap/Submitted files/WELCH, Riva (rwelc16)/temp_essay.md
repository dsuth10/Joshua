The Thing

One nice sunny day a family of three decided to go camping in one of the
biggest national parks, ever. When they got there one of their dad\'s
old friends appeared from the blue and decided to stay with them for a
few nights. Everything was nice and there were all having a nice time
until a very strange sound woke them up, but they just thought it was a
wild dog or something, so they went back to bed.

The next day they went outside and saw massive claw marks about eight
feet up of the ground so the decided to tell the ranges, but the rangers
said probbly a black bear or something, so they believed them but not
knowing their life is at stake. One night there barged through the door
yelling lock the doors and tomorrow were leaving but their mum and his
friend who completely shocked and tried to calm him down ask what
happened and what he saw. He described it as eight feet tall human like
a very fury with sha piercing ears and yellow Soules eyes.

Know on believed him and he didn\'t even believe himself, so they ended
up staying. few night pass and they all see it, so they decide to move
spots, and it worked know on saw that thing again but all that changed,
because their dad went for a walk and came sprinting back yelling get
the guns while also clamming the thing is back and it is chasing him so
they got the got the guns but by the time this came was right the
standing menacingly so the shot it POW! Blood drained out of it but it
was still alive, and it ran at the dad brutally biting straight through
the dad so his friend hid under the rv but the mum and child tried to
hide but all he heard was the bloodthirsty scream as the both got ripped
apart to shreds. The next day the dad\'s friend came out from under the
rv to see the dad ripped apart on the ground and the mum in the bush
with the daughter in the tree dripping blood. RAW! But he was not safe.
