Title: Ava And The Bear

Once there was a little girl named Ava and everyday she found sticks and
built mini little castles out of them at school, she was six at the time
and every body said the little towers were so cool so she continued
making them everyday she got complements on the towers. One day she saw
her dad was sad and, in her head she was wondering why her dad was so
sad, his name was Johnathan and he got to her and she said confused

"Why are you so sad Dad?" He looked at her and said while crying his
eyes out his head "Your mother died this morning from a car crash" the
girl got home and was too sad to play on the trampoline or her Nintendo
switch so she went outside and saw a bear standing at the door she
screamed louder than a whistle and she sprinted to her bedroom screaming
and the bear went into her bedroom and somehow writ the girl a letter
that said "I wont hurt you" she barely managed to read it

The girl and the bear went for a walk to the park and everyone ran out
of the gates and it was just the girl and the bear and the girl. The
girl went to the hospital praying for her mum to be alive again and as
she walked out of the room she thought it was no use but as she walked
out she heard her mum very quietly saying her name she didn\'t hear her
"Wait Ava" she said softly Ava heard her and turned around and hugged
her not too tight so it wouldn\'t hurt her. A few years later Ava
becomes a teacher at Mount Crosby State School
