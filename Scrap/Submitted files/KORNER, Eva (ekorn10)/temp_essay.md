Title: The Frog Mystery

I'm Eva, this year I am turning 11 in April. But something about me is
that, I LOVE NUTELLA! I would spend all my money on 1000 bottles! But
everyday something crazy happens! Like yesterday there were cat stickers
EVERYWHERE!! At school, on the road, on my clothes. Literally
everywhere! And no-one knew who did it!

It was Monday, the 3^rd^ week of school and I was getting ready, I had
toast for breakfast, did my hair and teeth. So I just needed to put my
shoes and my uniform on. But then I started to hear, frogs and toads. I
looked out my window and it was RAINING FROGS! So many questions! How
did the frogs get there? How is it even possible? What will happen to
them? DING! My mum got a email from her laptop. " School is closed, due
to raining frogs." "YES! No school I yelled with excitement. But I was
so confused. How will the frogs leave? Will they just stay here forever?
I got my iPad and messaged my friend "Olivia"

You: Oh my gosh! Have you looked outside?

Olivia: Yes! Raining frogs is awesome, and soooo cool!

You: I know right?!

Me and Olivia had a little chat. But, on the news they said they would
get big nets and scoop all the frogs and toads tomorrow at 9am. So I
will have to wake up early to watch out my window! But this is so weird
and cool at the same time!?

Ding Ding. My alarm bell goes, its 8:58. I jumped out of bed and put a
chair right at the window. 9am just hit the clock. There are about 100
people with huge nets. By 10am all the frogs are gone!

Thats a day in the life with me!
