Title: The unlucky to lucky

RING RING! Milly woke up feeling like nothing and was exughsted. She
went downstairs and made herself some breakfast. Then she pulled out her
laptop and looked at how much debt she was in! Milly new that she needed
a job but luck was never on her side but then she found a perfect job!
BABYSITTING CATS!!!!!!!

Milly has always loved cats and new this job was perfect for her .So she
started to look at cats that needed to be looked after and found this
black cat named lucky who didn\'t have a owner and needed a home but
Milly really wanted to adopt him but she new she couldn\'t .But she
couldn\'t give up on a poor little black cat who needed a home so she
decided to take him in. So the next morning she went shopping for cat
toys and cat things. Then she went to pick him up from a shelter. She
saw his collar and it had a coin attached in the middle she didn\'t know
what is was but she left it on. Then she got really unlucky and left the
door open and lucky escaped.

She looked everywhere but then she decided to go home and then she found
him snuggled up on her couch. For a whole week she was very unlucky but
the cat seemed to have a lot of luck. Then she found the cat stuck in
the cat tree that she bought and found the coin on the floor. She helped
lucky get out of the situation and she heled onto the coin.

From that day on she was very lucky but the cat was not. Then one day
the lucky coin fell out her pocket and lost it.

Now they were both VERY unlucky so she looked everywhere but it was
nowhere to be seen.

But then she saw it on the sideway where she was walking back from the
shops and THEY WERE SEMENTING IT INTO THE FLOOR WITHOUT KNOWING. Milly
rushed down there and stuck her hands in the cement and got it
out!!!!!!.But she was faced with a big fine but everything got very
lucky from that day on including getting the fine taken away!

Milly and Lucky lived a very good life from that small coin with a four
leaf clover on it!
