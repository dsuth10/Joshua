Title: The Dinosaur

One balmy afternoon, Rosey decided to go exploring into the vast jungle.
She was wondering what she might find in there. She packed her bag and
set off to the jungle. The aroma smelt of sweet ecliptics and she heard
the chirping from the little birds and parrots. She explored deeper and
deeper. Suddenly Rosey heard a weird noise, outstanding from the others.

She went in the direction of the noise. She was getting slightly nervous
because she might get lost. She walked into a clearing, and she couldn't
believe what her eyes were seeing. "Oh my gosh!" she exclaimed. "I don't
believe this!" Right in front of her was a stegosaurs!

She ran back remerging where she came from and sprinted into her home
and into her Mum and Dad's room. "Mum, Dad, you won't believe this!" she
cried.

"What is it, Rosey?" asked Mum.

"I saw a stegosaurs in the woods!" I exclaimed

"Ye right now. There can't possibly be a dinosaur in the jungle,"
explained Dad.

"You look for yourselves!" I exclaimed, eager to let them see.

"OK." sighed Mum, "But hopefully it wasn't just your imagination,"

Rosey went the same direction she remembered with Mum and Dad following
closely behind her, and soon enough they came to the clearing and saw
the stegosaurus. "OMG!" exclaimed Mum and Dad at the same time. No one
knew how the dinosaurs still lived till today. Everyone thought they
were extinced. But this shows they were wrong the whole time.

"Wow, you would become a great adventurist for sure." said Dad
excitedly.

Later Rosey became an adventurist and the scientists studied on the
stegosaurs. Soon after Rosey even found some other species of dinosaurs
such as Triceratops and Centrosaurus. All the people were amazed and the
whole world knew about Rosey and her find.
