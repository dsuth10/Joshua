            <h2>A Disaster Unfolds</h2>
            <p>In January 2011, Brisbane experienced one of the worst natural disasters in Australia's history. The
                Brisbane River burst its banks, flooding thousands of homes and businesses across the city. It was a
                catastrophe that would change Brisbane forever.</p>
            <p>The 2011 floods were part of a much larger disaster that affected most of Queensland. By the time the
                waters receded, 33 people had lost their lives, over 20,000 homes were flooded, and the damage bill
                reached billions of dollars.</p>

            <p>The 2011 Brisbane floods weren't caused by a single event. Instead, several factors combined to create

            <h2>Remembering 2011</h2>
            <p>Today, Brisbane has largely recovered from the 2011 floods. New buildings have been constructed,
                infrastructure has been rebuilt, and life has returned to normal. However, the floods remain a powerful
                reminder of nature's force and the importance of being prepared.</p>
            <p class="final-thought">The 2011 Brisbane floods showed both the worst and the best of humanity—the
                devastating power of nature and the incredible resilience and kindness of people coming together in
                times of crisis.</p>
