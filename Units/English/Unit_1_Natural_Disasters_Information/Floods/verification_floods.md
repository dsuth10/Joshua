**UNDERSTANDING FLOODS**

*When Water Takes Over*

What is a Flood?

A flood happens when water overflows onto land that is normally dry.
Floods are one of the most common natural disasters in Australia and
around the world. They can happen quickly or build up slowly over days
or weeks.

When heavy rain falls, rivers and creeks can fill up faster than the
water can flow away. The extra water spills over the banks and spreads
across the surrounding land. In cities, drains and stormwater systems
can become overwhelmed, causing water to pool in streets and low-lying
areas.

What Causes Floods?

Floods can be caused by several different factors, often working
together:

- **Heavy Rainfall** - When it rains heavily for a long time, the ground
  becomes saturated and can\'t absorb any more water. The excess water
  runs into rivers and creeks.

- **Rapid Snowmelt** - In mountainous areas, when snow melts quickly in
  spring, large amounts of water flow into rivers all at once.

- **Storm Surges** - During severe storms or cyclones, strong winds can
  push ocean water onto the coast, flooding coastal areas.

- **Dam or Levee Failure** - When structures built to hold back water
  break or overflow, massive amounts of water are suddenly released.

- **Human Activities** - Building on floodplains, removing vegetation,
  and creating hard surfaces like roads and car parks can make flooding
  worse by preventing water from soaking into the ground.

Types of Floods

Different types of floods have different causes and characteristics.
Understanding these differences helps communities prepare and respond
effectively.

Flash Floods

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **What They Are**                 | **Common Causes**                 |
|                                   |                                   |
| Flash floods are the most         | - Intense thunderstorms dumping   |
| dangerous type of flood. They     |   large amounts of rain quickly   |

| within minutes or a few hours of  | - Tropical cyclones bringing      |
| heavy rainfall. The water rises   |   extreme rainfall                |
| rapidly and flows with tremendous |                                   |

| **Speed:** Develop in less than 6 | - Urban areas where concrete      |

|                                   |                                   |
| **Warning time:** Very little or  |                                   |

River Floods (Riverine Flooding)

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **What They Are**                 | **Common Causes**                 |

| River floods occur when rivers    | - Prolonged heavy rainfall over a |
| overflow their banks. These       |   river catchment                 |
| floods usually develop more       |                                   |
| slowly than flash floods, giving  | - Rapid snowmelt in mountain      |

Coastal Floods

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

| Coastal floods happen when        | - Storm surges from tropical      |
| seawater floods normally dry      |   cyclones or severe storms       |
| coastal land. Rising sea levels   |                                   |
| due to climate change are making  | - Unusually high tides (king      |
| coastal flooding more common,     |   tides)                          |
| even on calm, sunny days.         |                                   |
|                                   | - Tsunamis from underwater        |
| **Speed:** Varies---can be sudden |   earthquakes                     |
| or gradual                        |                                   |

Comparing the Three Types

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Type**          **Speed**         **Warning Time**  **Danger Level**
  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------
  **Flash Flood**   Very fast         Little to none    Extremely high
                    (minutes to                         
                    hours)                              

  **River Flood**   Slower (hours to  Several hours to  Moderate to high
                    days)             days              

  **Coastal Flood** Varies            Varies            Moderate to very
                                                        high

Staying Safe

No matter what type of flood threatens your area, remember these
important safety rules:

1.  **Never walk, swim, or drive through floodwater.** It only takes 15
    centimetres of fast-flowing water to knock you off your feet, and 60
    centimetres to sweep away a car.

2.  **Listen to emergency warnings** on the radio, TV, or your phone.

3.  **If told to evacuate, leave immediately.** Don\'t wait until it\'s
    too late.

4.  **Move to higher ground** if you\'re in a flood-prone area and water
    is rising.
