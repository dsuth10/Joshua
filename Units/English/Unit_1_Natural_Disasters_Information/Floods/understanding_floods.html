            <h2>What is a Flood?</h2>
            <p>A flood happens when water overflows onto land that is normally dry. Floods are one of the most common natural disasters in Australia and around the world. They can happen quickly or build up slowly over days or weeks.</p>
            <p>When heavy rain falls, rivers and creeks can fill up faster than the water can flow away. The extra water spills over the banks and spreads across the surrounding land. In cities, drains and stormwater systems can become overwhelmed, causing water to pool in streets and low-lying areas.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>What Causes Floods?</h2>
            <p>Floods can be caused by several different factors, often working together:</p>

                    <div class="cause-icon">🌧️</div>
                    <h3>Heavy Rainfall</h3>
                    <p>When it rains heavily for a long time, the ground becomes saturated and can't absorb any more water. The excess water runs into rivers and creeks.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cause-card">
                    <div class="cause-icon">❄️</div>
                    <h3>Rapid Snowmelt</h3>
                    <p>In mountainous areas, when snow melts quickly in spring, large amounts of water flow into rivers all at once.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cause-card">
                    <div class="cause-icon">🌊</div>
                    <h3>Storm Surges</h3>
                    <p>During severe storms or cyclones, strong winds can push ocean water onto the coast, flooding coastal areas.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cause-card">
                    <div class="cause-icon">🏗️</div>
                    <h3>Dam or Levee Failure</h3>
                    <p>When structures built to hold back water break or overflow, massive amounts of water are suddenly released.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cause-card">
                    <div class="cause-icon">🏙️</div>
                    <h3>Human Activities</h3>
                    <p>Building on floodplains, removing vegetation, and creating hard surfaces like roads and car parks can make flooding worse by preventing water from soaking into the ground.</p>
