                <p>For decades, people in Northern Australia have told stories about "Firehawks"—birds that
                    intentionally spread fire. Scientists are now combines Indigenous knowledge with eyewitness accounts
                    to study this amazing behaviour. While some experts are still looking for video proof, local rangers
                    and firefighters have seen these avian arsonists in action many times.</p>

                    <li class="reveal-step"><strong>2. Stick Acquisition:</strong> They find a smouldering stick and
                        grab it with their beak or talons.</li>
                    <li class="reveal-step"><strong>3. Transport:</strong> They fly up to 1 kilometre away, often
                        crossing roads or rivers.</li>
                    <li class="reveal-step"><strong>4. Deposition:</strong> The burning stick is dropped into dry,
                        unburnt grass.</li>
                    <li class="reveal-step"><strong>5. Feeding:</strong> As the new fire flushes out insects and
                        lizards, the bird swoops in for an easy meal!</li>

                <p>The Firehawk is a bridge between two worlds of knowledge. It teaches us that nature is full of
                    surprises and that human beings aren't the only ones who can master the power of fire. For students
                    in Australia, it's a reminder to look closely at the bush—there might be a master hunter at work in
